# Inheritance2



### contains :

1. Restaurant Class

2. Review Class

3. MovieReview

4. Shop

5. Theater

6. Place

### Requirements :

* Continue working in your inheritance library. Start by refactoring any of the relationships that you created in the last lab . 

* The users want shops! Create a Shop class; a Shop should have a name, description, and number of dollar signs.

* The users also want to review shops.

* The users want theaters! Create a Theater class; a Theater should have a name and all of the movies currently showing there. (Strings are fine for the movies; no need to create another class.

* Review all the things.

* Users are frustrated: they like having a body, an author, and a number of stars, but when theyâ€™re reviewing a Theater, they also want to specify which movie they saw.

### Testing :
* In library test you can run the test .
*  or cd into inheritance directory and run `./gradlew test`.
